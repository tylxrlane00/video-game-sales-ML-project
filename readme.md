# Video Game Sales ML Project

This project analyzes video game sales data and builds a machine learning model to predict whether a game will be top-grossing. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, baseline model creation, and an improved model (Iteration 1) with predictions and visual outputs.

---

## **Project Structure**

### **Folders**
- **baseline-model-results/** – Outputs and reports from the baseline model (`baseline.py`).
- **outputs_iter1/** – Metrics, plots, and saved models from Iteration 1 (`model_iter1.py`).
- **predictions_out/** – Predictions and charts generated by `predict.py`.

### **Main Python Scripts**
- **baseline.py** – Trains baseline models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Dummy Classifier) and evaluates their performance.
- **model_iter1.py** – Builds an improved model with class balancing, cross-validation, and saves the best model as `best_iter1_model.pkl`.
- **predict.py** – Loads a trained model and generates predictions (CSV/Excel), along with charts like confusion matrix and probability distribution.
- **dataPrep_topgrossing.py** – Prepares and cleans the top-grossing games dataset. ('Retrieved from https://github.com/mfun06/ACS5513Data')
- **dataPrep_vgsales.py** – Prepares and cleans the VGChartz sales dataset. ('Retrieved from https://github.com/mfun06/ACS5513Data')
- **merged_features.py** – Merges datasets into a feature set for model training. ('Retrieved from https://github.com/mfun06/ACS5513Data')
- **dataset2_features.py** – Handles feature engineering for a second dataset. ('Retrieved from https://github.com/mfun06/ACS5513Data')

### **Data Files**
- **vgsales.csv** – Raw video game sales data.
- **feature_set_1.csv** – Feature set derived from the cleaned datasets, used for model training. ('Retrieved from https://github.com/mfun06/ACS5513Data')
- **feature_set_2.csv** – Alternative or extended feature set. ('Retrieved from https://github.com/mfun06/ACS5513Data')


### **Other Files**
- **requirements.txt** – Python dependencies needed to run the project.
